## üìù Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Firebase account (for authentication)
- OpenAI and Gemini API keys
- Pinecone API key (for vector database)
- Stripe account (for payments)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/askmydoc.git
   cd askmydoc
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:  
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_API_KEY=your_clerk_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

### Deployment

To deploy the project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), follow these steps:

1. Push your project to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect your repository to Vercel.
3. Add your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
4. Deploy the app with a single click.

## üí° How It Works

1. **User uploads a PDF**: Users can upload their PDF documents to the application.
2. **AI Query Processing**: The system uses LangChain with OpenAI and Gemini APIs to extract information from the PDF, split it into chunks, and create vector embeddings with Pinecone.
3. **Answer Questions**: Users can ask questions, and the AI will provide accurate, document-specific answers using the indexed PDF data.
4. **Pro Plan**: Users can upgrade to the Pro plan through Stripe to enjoy enhanced features such as processing larger files and priority support.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Future Improvements

- **Multilingual Support**: Support for more languages beyond English.
- **More File Types**: Extend beyond PDFs to support Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
- **Mobile App**: Build a companion mobile app for iOS and Android.
